\title{
Estimate s with LLS
}
\description{
\code{lm.s} estimates s with linear least squares regression.
}
\usage{
lm.s(ctraj, haploid, maxiter = 10, tol = 0.01)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ctraj}{
a consensus trajectory as returned by \code{\link{consensus.traj}}.
}
  \item{haploid}{
logical indicating wether a population of haploid (\code{haploid = TRUE}) or diploid (default) individuals should be simulated.
}
  \item{maxiter}{
integer defining the maximum number of iterations to correct for discrepancies between a selection model with discrete or overlapping generations.
}
  \item{tol}{
numeric specifying the tolerance for the iterative bias correction. If \code{tol = 0.01}, then the correction procedure will stop once the deviation between the discrete and continuouse model is less than 1\%.
}
}
\details{
Instead of calling this function directly, use \code{\link{estimateSH}} instead.
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with estimates of both s and p0 is returned.
